Engula is a storage engine that empowers engineers to build reliable and cost-effective databases with less effort and more confidence.

Engula's design goals are as follows:

- Elastic: leverages elastic resources on the cloud
- Adaptive: optimizes for dynamic workloads and diverse applications
- Extensible: provides pluggable APIs and components for customization
- Platform independent: allows flexible deployments on local hosts, on-premise servers, and cloud platforms

This is the main branch, which is still in the initial phase.

We have released Demo 1 in Oct 2021.
