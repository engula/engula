Engula is a storage engine that empowers engineers to build reliable and cost-effective databases with less effort and more confidence.

Engula's design goals are as follows:

- **Elastic**: takes advantage of elastic resources on the cloud
- **Adaptive**: adapts to dynamic workloads and diverse applications
- **Extensible**: provides pluggable APIs and modules for customization
- **Platform independent**: allows flexible deployments on local hosts, on-premise servers, and cloud platforms
