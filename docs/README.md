# Engula Development Documentation

This is a collaborative effort to build a guide that explains how Engula works. The aim of the guide is to help new contributors get oriented to Engula, as well as to help more experienced folks in figuring out some new part of the storage engine that they haven't worked on before.

Please check the top-level [design document](design.md) to get started.
